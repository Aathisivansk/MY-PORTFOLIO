# **App Name**: Liquid Crystal OS Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Animated Liquid Background: A smoothly animated background gradient with dark blue, cyan, and purple colors to simulate a liquid crystal effect.
- Glassmorphic UI: Apply a glassmorphism design across all UI elements (windows, taskbar) using frosted glass panels with a subtle blur effect and thin borders.
- Desktop Interface with Folder Icons: Implement a desktop-like interface with clickable folder icons representing skill categories.
- Draggable and Resizable Windows: Create draggable and resizable windows that open when a folder icon is clicked, with minimize/maximize/close functionality.
- Dynamic Project Showcase: Dynamically render project details (Title, Contribution, Tech Stack, Flowchart Image, Demo Photo, Demo Video) inside the windows, collapsing sections when data is missing.
- Secure Admin Panel: A secure, private admin route with login authentication that will allow the site owner, aathisivan.dev, to manage the site.
- Data management in Firestore: Enable the administrator (aathisivan.dev) to create, read, update and delete Categories, Projects, and Blog posts using the Firestore database.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright cyan (#00FFFF) for a vibrant and modern feel.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D0D8E0) for a light mode glassmorphic effect.
- Accent color: Light purple (#D099EE) to complement the cyan and add depth.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', a modern sans-serif for a contemporary feel.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use flat, outlined icons to match the OS aesthetic. Icons should use the bright cyan color (#00FFFF) when active or hovered.
- Employ a desktop-like layout with a fixed taskbar at the bottom. Windows should be draggable and resizable. Content should be aligned and spaced for optimal readability.
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for window opening/closing, hovering effects on icons, and the background gradient. Use subtle effects to enhance the OS feel.
